# Drone SDK

## Overview
The Drone SDK is a comprehensive software development kit designed for building applications that interact with drones. It provides modules for telemetry, sensor integration, event handling, and machine learning capabilities, enabling developers to create advanced drone applications.

## Features
- **Telemetry Module**: Collects and processes real-time data from the drone, including GPS, attitude, battery, and IMU data.
- **Sensor Integration**: Interfaces with various sensors such as cameras, LIDAR, and ultrasonic sensors for enhanced environmental awareness.
- **Event Handling**: Monitors telemetry data and triggers events based on specific conditions, such as low battery or poor GPS signal.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Supports loading and running machine learning models for advanced features like object detection and terrain classification.
- **REST API**: Exposes SDK functionality via a RESTful API for easy integration with other systems.

## Installation
To install the Drone SDK, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drone-sdk.git
cd drone-sdk
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Initializing the SDK
To use the Drone SDK, you need to initialize the necessary modules:

```python
from dronesdk.telemetry import TelemetryStream
from dronesdk.sensors import CameraInterface

# Initialize telemetry stream
telemetry_stream = TelemetryStream(connection_manager)

# Initialize camera interface
camera = CameraInterface(camera_id=0)
camera.initialize()
```

### Starting Telemetry
To start collecting telemetry data:

```python
await telemetry_stream.start()
```

### Capturing Images
To capture images from the camera:

```python
frame = camera.capture_frame()
```

### Monitoring Events
You can register callbacks for specific events:

```python
from dronesdk.telemetry import EventHandler

event_handler = EventHandler()

def low_battery_callback(battery_data):
    print(f"Low battery: {battery_data.remaining}%")

event_handler.on("low_battery", low_battery_callback)
```
